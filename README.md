# Practice_strings

# Interning 

It is the done to save the space


String str="Anjali";

String str1="Anjali";

// in heap it will point to the same string no  two different string anjali will be formed

* new keyword can be used to avoid the interning.
* Due to interning there exists immutebility in the string.

# Performance of the string:

* Due to immutibility there is the poor performance of the string.

# problems with the String:
* Interning
* immutibile
* poor performance

# Need of the string Builder
* There was no function available as setChar() but charAt() function was available but we can also set the character in the string builder.
